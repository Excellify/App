## Feature Updates - 6/10/21

* **Added Channel Emote Aliases**
> You can now set an alias on an emote which only applies to your channel. This also works when acting as an editor.

* **Upgraded the Home page layout**
> It should look a bit cleaner and use space more efficiently

* **Increased animation speeds on the emote list**

* **Added Featured Broadcast Slot**
> Streams which use 7TV may be featured on the home page. At this time, this is hand-selected by our team, but in the future will likely become a random rotation for known streamers or 7TV subscribers

* **Unlisted and Private emotes will now appear blurred on profile pages**
> To prevent potentially undesirable content showing up on livestreams, unlisted or privated emotes will be blurred when visiting a profile page. Hovering over the card for a bit will unblur.

* **Added changelogs**
> too much recursion

* **Made it possible to middle-click the navigation tabs**

* **7tv.app is now a Progressive Web App**
